    "Now we know that most of our features have skewed distributions, some are highly correlated with one another, and some appear to have non-linear relationships with our target variable.  Also, for targeting future prospects, good predictive accuracy is preferred to being able to explain why that prospect was targeted.  Taken together, these aspects make gradient boosted trees a good candidate algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several intricacies to understanding the algorithm, but at a high level, gradient boosted trees works by combining predictions from many simple models, each of which tries to address the weaknesses of the previous models.  By doing this the collection of simple models can actually outperform large, complex models.  Other Amazon SageMaker notebooks elaborate on gradient boosting trees further and how they differ from similar algorithms.\n",

It is computationally powerful, fully featured, and has been successfully used in many machine learning competitions.  Let's start with a simple `xgboost` model, trained using Amazon SageMaker's managed, distributed training framework."

    "## Automatic model Tuning (optional)\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker automatic model tuning, also known as hyperparameter tuning, finds the best version of a model by running many training jobs on your dataset using the algorithm and ranges of hyperparameters that you specify. It then chooses the hyperparameter values that result in a model that performs the best, as measured by a metric that you choose.\n",
    "For example, suppose that you want to solve a binary classification problem on this marketing dataset. Your goal is to maximize the area under the curve (auc) metric of the algorithm by training an XGBoost Algorithm model. You don't know which values of the eta, alpha, min_child_weight, and max_depth hyperparameters to use to train the best model. To find the best values for these hyperparameters, you can specify ranges of values that Amazon SageMaker hyperparameter tuning searches to find the combination of values that results in the training job that performs the best as measured by the objective metric that you chose. Hyperparameter tuning launches training jobs that use hyperparameter values in the ranges that you specified, and returns the training job with highest auc.\n"

In order to improve predictive accuracy further, we could tweak value we threshold our predictions at to alter the mix of false-positives and false-negatives, or we could explore techniques like hyperparameter tuning.  In a real-world scenario, we would also spend more time engineering features by hand and would likely look for additional datasets to include which contain customer information not available in our initial dataset."
